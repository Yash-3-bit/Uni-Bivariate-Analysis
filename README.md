# Uni-Bivariate-Analysis
Univariate Analysis:
Univariate analysis is a type of data analysis that focuses on one variable at a time. The primary objective is to describe the variable's central tendency, distribution, and spread. In Python, univariate analysis can be performed using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.


Bivariate Analysis:
Bivariate analysis involves the simultaneous analysis of two variables to explore the relationship between them. This analysis helps in understanding how one variable affects another and can be used for both categorical and continuous variables.
